# Real-World-Data-Wrangling-with-Python

Main Steps

Gather Two Related Datasets

Successfully gather two related datasets using two different data gathering methods (e.g., manual download, programmatic download, APIs, web scraping, databases, etc.).
Ensure the datasets have a logical connection, such as being complementary in content or sharing a common key for merging.
Note 1: To meet project requirements, select datasets that have at least 2 quality and 2 tidiness issues. This will allow you to apply the cleaning and wrangling skills needed to meet the project rubric.
Note 2: The need to merge the datasets indicates an existing data tidiness issue: a single observation is spread across multiple tables. You may include this issue and identify just one more additional data tidiness issue. More information on data tidiness rules is available on Step 2: Assess Data.
Assess Data for Quality and Tidiness

Evaluate the data according to quality and tidiness metrics, such as missing values, inconsistencies, and structural issues.
Identify specific areas where data is missing or exhibits inconsistencies that could affect analysis.
Clean the Data to Resolve Identified Issues

Apply cleaning techniques to address the issues found during assessment, including handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and structural improvements to achieve a tidy dataset.
Update Data Store with Cleaned Data

Save and organize the cleaned data for analysis, ensuring the final datasets are ready for visualization and interpretation.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate visualizations and summaries of the cleaned data.
Answer a brief research question based on insights from the EDA, using appropriate charts and descriptive statistics to support your answer.
